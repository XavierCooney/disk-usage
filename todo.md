FOR FUTURE ME:
 * Fix indexing for file's without permission (not sure how. Some Windows API?)
 * Fix issue with horizontal scrollbar changing viewport height
 * Change backend to cache by number of subfiles/folders rather than size (I assume os.stat is constant to size of file?)
 * Test and fix file paths with a pipe `|` in them
